# The web panel

The panel is a small local web interface for the operator: providers, accounts, combos, keys,
aliases, quota, and the documentation. It runs on the **control plane**, port 20901 by default,
which is a different process and a different port from the relay on 20900.

That separation is the one architectural rule the panel must never break.

## Why it is a separate process

A request path and an admin page have incompatible cost profiles. The request path must do a
predictable, tiny amount of work per request; an admin page runs queries, renders lists, and is
allowed to be slow because a human is waiting for it.

Putting them in one process means they share an event loop, and a shared event loop means the slow
thing eventually blocks the fast thing. This is not hypothetical: the reference router measured in
[Latency benchmarks §1](19-latency-benchmarks.md#1-the-baseline-that-motivated-the-project) took
5.2–9.2 seconds to serve a purely local `/v1/models` request. An admin route mounted on the same
router was part of why.

So the panel cannot slow down a completion. The worst a broken panel can do is fail to render, and
the worst an admin query can do is fail to return — neither touches a token of anyone's inference.

The two processes share state through files, not through IPC: the conductor writes
`config.json` and the compiled snapshot, and the relay reads the snapshot. See
[Routing snapshot](04-routing-snapshot.md).

## Views

| View | Shows | Can change |
|---|---|---|
| **Overview** | Control-plane uptime, relay reachability, snapshot digest and age, configuration counts, and whether a panel password is set | Nothing |
| **Providers** | Every provider, its dialect, base URL, auth, key strategy, cooldown scope, account count, and health, with that provider's accounts and models inline under its own row | Add, edit, enable/disable, remove; add, enable/disable and remove accounts; pin providers and sort by name, date added, number of keys or manual order, dragging rows to reorder |
| **Models** | Discovered and hand-entered models per provider, model-first so the same id from several providers sits together, with provider/source/search/hidden filters and paging | Hide/show, delete, and **test** a model (one small live request; the answer or the upstream error is shown as a toast). Paging offers 50, 100, 250 or 500 rows. **Resync all models** and **Delete all models** loop over the per-provider endpoints; deletion still asks for an explicit confirmation. The test runs on the relay's loopback probe (`POST /control/probe`), so it goes through the ordinary dispatch path — routing table, dialect translation, account selection, cooldowns and fallbacks — and works for every dialect, not only the OpenAI shape. The route refuses non-loopback callers because it skips the client-key check |
| **Combos** | Every combo with its steps **in priority order**, each model step's optional pinned reasoning level, and a **Live health** panel | Create, edit, reorder steps, enable/disable, remove, pin a model step's reasoning level, and **check** the steps: one tiny completion per enabled model step through the relay probe, in priority order, so the panel shows which step answers right now and which one failed and why. A step may instead route to another combo; it has no provider, model or level of its own, is shown as a nested combo, and is checked in that combo rather than probed here. Provider, model and combo pickers are searchable. A cycle between nested combos is refused with the chain that closes it |
| **Keys** | Client keys by label and prefix | Create (plaintext shown once), edit the policy, rotate the secret in place (new plaintext shown once, old secret invalidated after commit), enable/disable, delete |
| **Aliases** | Alias to target mappings | Add, remove |
| **Quota** | Allowances first, grouped by provider: each provider block has a heading, a strip of its accounts' window chips, and one card per account, laid out so several accounts share a wide page and a phone gets one full-width card, with one row per window the provider actually reported — then the recent request ledger underneath. Provider blocks and the account cards inside them can be dragged; that changes only this page. A provider that quantifies a single window gets a single row, never padding for the families it did not mention; an account with nothing quantified (never fetched, or no reported fraction) is left off the page rather than shown as an empty shell. An account whose refresh *failed* keeps its last-good card and the error when an earlier fetch left a quantified window to show; a failure with no window (including before the first snapshot) stays off the page too | Refresh an account's windows from the provider (key *and* OAuth accounts: the conductor mints the same short-lived token the relay would); reorder provider blocks and accounts for display |
| **Settings** | Listen ports, client-key access, upstream proxies, the relay connection pool (including a low-resource profile), quota display, pricing data, the panel password, and the raw configuration | Edit; **ports apply on next restart** |
| **Documentation** | The top-level files in `docs/`, rendered from markdown | Nothing |

The **Models** view distinguishes discovered from hand-entered metadata explicitly, because a sync
must never overwrite what a human typed. If the two ever disagreed and the panel did not say which
was which, the operator would have no way to know why their edit vanished.

### Paging and bulk model actions

The Models filters are applied before anything is drawn: provider, source, a case-insensitive
search over model id and label, and a **hidden only** switch. The matching rows are sorted
model-first, with the provider as the tie-break, so the same model offered by several providers is
compared side by side. Only one page is rendered, at 50, 100, 250 or 500 rows. The pager states the
visible range, the total and the page count, and the page resets when a filter changes. Paging is a
rendering concern only; it does not change the configuration or what the relay serves.

The two bulk buttons are loops over the same per-provider endpoints used by the detail view, not a
second bulk API. A resync runs providers one at a time so a sync sweep does not trip their rate
limits, and reports every provider that failed. **Delete all models** states the exact count and
warns that combos, aliases and clients naming those models will stop resolving; only an explicit
confirmation starts it. Provider records, accounts, client keys and combos are left alone.

### Display order is not configuration

Pinning and sorting providers are browser preferences. Pinned providers stay in a group above the
unpinned ones in every sort mode, and a drag freezes the order currently on screen
and switches the sort to **Manual**. A move never crosses the pinned boundary, because doing so
would silently change which group the row belongs to. **Date added** means the order the server
returned the providers in; provider records carry no timestamp. The preference is stored in this
browser under `manarouter.providers.pins`, `manarouter.providers.order` and
`manarouter.providers.sort`; another browser sees the server's order.

The Quota page keeps a separate display order: provider blocks first, and the account cards inside
each provider. Dragging a block or card writes only that list to
`manarouter.quota.provider-order` or `manarouter.quota.account-order`. It never changes which
account is fetched, which account the relay selects, or the configuration on disk. New providers
and accounts that are not in a stored list follow the server's order, so a later addition appears
in a predictable place rather than disappearing.

### Unsaved combo edits

A combo editor tracks whether it has been changed. While it is dirty, a route change asks first:
**Stay on this page** keeps the editor and its typed values, and **Leave and discard** abandons
them. The URL is restored to the page that is still on screen when the operator stays, including
after a browser Back or Forward. Closing the drawer or pressing Escape asks the same question with
**Keep editing** and **Discard changes**; so does starting a new combo or opening a different
combo's editor while a draft is open. Saving, deleting, or reverting clears the guard, so the next
navigation does not produce a stale prompt. A reload or tab close is also blocked while the
editor is dirty, using the browser's own leave confirmation.

The **Quota** view is built to be read in two passes. It is grouped by provider: each block
starts with the provider name, and its strip lists that provider's accounts' windows as chips —
name, percentage *left*, colour, `Resets in:` countdown. Clicking a chip scrolls to that account's
card inside the same block, so a tired account is found without reading every card. Each card takes
the colour of its most exhausted window and draws every window the provider reported as a row:
name, a bar filled with what is **remaining**, the percentage left and used in words, and the reset
countdown on the right. Green is above 50 % left, amber at 50 % or less, red at 20 % or less, and
grey when a window is unlimited. The colour is always a second copy of a number the row states in
words — it never carries the meaning alone, and a window that arrives without a fraction is not
drawn at all rather than painted red or green. The page does not print the snapshot's `source` URL
or its per-window `details`; both stay in `/api/quota` for diagnosis, because beside the percentage
they buried the number the page exists to show.

## The live combo block

Under the Combos item in the sidebar there is one small block that answers a single question: what is
a combo doing right now?

It is fed by `GET /api/activity`, which the control plane proxies to the relay's loopback
`GET /control/activity`. The relay is the only process that can answer: it makes the routing decision
and it holds the account cooldowns, and neither fact is written to disk. The block polls every 1.5
seconds through the panel's shared scheduler, which stops entirely while the tab is hidden.

It has four states:

| State | Shows |
|---|---|
| **live** | The combo on the first line and the `provider/model` the relay committed to on the second. A green edge and a pulsing dot mark it as in flight; the word *live* is in the accessible label, tooltip and live region instead of taking a third visible line. A request stays *live* for as long as the client is still receiving it |
| **recent** | The newest decision, with the same two lines, because a combo that ran an hour ago is still the answer to "what did it do". The tooltip and accessible label say it is the last decision |
| **no combo activity yet** | The relay is reachable and has served no combo since it started |
| **control plane unreachable** | The panel could not ask. A different sentence from the one above on purpose: "nothing is running" and "I cannot see" are not the same fact, and the panel must not blur them |

The two-line block is a link: clicking it opens the combo it is describing, by name, so the deep
link works even when the operator has not memorised the combo's id. The block is a fixed 52 px tall
on purpose. It fills and empties as requests come and go, and every navigation item below it has to
stay exactly where it was; the longest route is clipped with the full text in the element's
`title`, and hovering the block expands it in place. It is not an `aria-live` region: it is
repainted on every poll, and a polite region rewritten every 1.5 seconds reads the same sentence
over and over. The announcement lives in a separate `sr-only` status span that changes only when
the state or the route changes.

An entry is finished when the client-facing response body is dropped, so a stream that the client
abandons is finished promptly rather than waiting for a timer to expire. Restarting the relay forgets
the whole ring, which is the honest scope of a fact about in-flight work.

## The design language

The whole panel follows one rule that is more useful than any palette:

> **Greys carry all the structure. A single accent is used for emphasis and interaction.
> The accent is never used for destructive actions or errors.**

So borders, headings, tables, dividers, disabled controls and secondary text are all greys. The
accent appears on the focused control, the selected tab, and the primary action — the things a
person is meant to look at or click. Nothing else.

Semantic colours handle meaning, and they are a separate vocabulary from the accent:

| Colour | Hex | Means |
|---|---|---|
| Green | `#4cc38a` | Healthy, ready, enabled |
| Amber | `#d9a441` | Degraded, cooling down, action needed |
| Red | `#ef6a6a` | Broken, refused, destructive |

Two consequences of taking that seriously:

**The accent is never red.** A destructive button does not become "the important one" by being
painted the emphasis colour; it is red, and it is still secondary to the primary action. Painting a
"Delete" button the same colour as "Save" is how interfaces get misclicked, and no amount of
confirmation dialog makes it acceptable.

**A semantic colour is never decorative.** Green in this panel always means a healthy state and never
"this looks nice". The moment green is used for styling, the operator can no longer scan for green
and find health.

### The case that catches people out

A provider whose accounts are all deliberately disabled is **`Unconfigured`, not `Dead`**.

This is a real distinction in the code — `ProviderHealth::from_counts(total, usable)` returns
`Unconfigured` when `total == 0` — and it has to survive to the screen. An operator who disabled
three accounts on purpose while changing providers should not see a red failure indicator for a
decision they made. Red is reserved for things that are wrong, and this is not wrong; it is parked.

Getting this wrong is not cosmetic. An operator who learns to ignore red because it is usually
crying wolf will also ignore the red that matters.

## Ports, restart, and the amber banner

The panel can change the relay and conductor ports, and a port change is **persisted but not
applied**. It is labelled "next restart", an amber banner appears, and the banner stays until the
restart happens.

The banner is not dismissible at all. It stays until the restart happens, because the cost of
forgetting that a change is pending is a confusing failure later ("I set the port, why is it still on
the old one?").

A **Restart** button applies it. The restart is never automatic, because rebinding a listening socket
means the old one closes, and everything connected to it — including an in-flight completion —
is dropped. An operator expects a settings change to take effect; they do not expect it to kill a
request that is mid-answer. Making the restart explicit turns a surprise into a decision.

## Authentication

- Bound to `127.0.0.1` by default, which requires no password.
- The listener can be bound to a non-loopback address (for example `0.0.0.0` so both `localhost`
  and the tailnet reach it), but the source address of every request is checked before anything
  else: only loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`) and the Tailscale/CGNAT range
  `100.64.0.0/10` (which covers the tailnet address `100.104.1.69`) are trusted. Everything else
  — any host on the LAN, anything routed from the internet — is refused with `403` before the
  origin check ever runs, so an external probe learns nothing about the panel.
- Binding `0.0.0.0` without a password is therefore not the same as exposing the panel to the
  internet, but a password is still the second line of defence: set it under Settings → Panel
  password. The one way past the password requirement is the explicit
  `control.allow_remote_without_password` opt-out.
- Passwords are stored as **Argon2id** hashes. Session lookup is constant-time, so a timing
  difference cannot be used to probe a token.
- Every mutating request must carry an acceptable `Origin`, which is checked before the handler runs.
  A cross-origin form post from a page the operator is merely visiting is the realistic attack on
  a loopback admin interface, and browsers will send it. "Acceptable" means loopback, or exactly the
  host the request was addressed to (its `Host` header): the panel is usable at whatever address it
  is bound to — a tailnet name or IP included — but a page on any other origin still cannot drive it.
  A same host on a *different* port is a different origin and is refused.
- Sessions last 12 hours. Logging out revokes that session; changing the password revokes all of
  them. A `401` from the panel's own API means exactly one thing — that session is over — and the
  panel answers it by returning to the sign-in screen. A *provider* that refuses a credential is a
  different failure, so the model test reports it with the provider's own status and wording (a
  provider `401` is surfaced as `502` by `POST /api/models/test`) and leaves you signed in: entering
  the panel password again cannot fix an expired provider grant, and signing you out would hide the
  verdict you were reading.

### Reaching the panel from another device

Binding the panel to a non-loopback address is what makes it reachable from a phone or laptop on the
same tailnet, and it is the only way: the panel and the relay are ordinary listeners, so a tailnet
address or an SSH tunnel works, while a reverse proxy on another host does not change the bind.

Set the addresses in `config.json` (`control.host`, `relay.host`) — Settings → Raw configuration
edits and validates it in place, or edit the file and restart both services. `mr config` is a stub,
so there is no command for this yet.

Two things follow from that, and they are deliberate:

- Only loopback and tailnet sources are trusted by source address, so the panel is reachable from a
  phone or laptop on the same tailnet without exposing it to anything else. Prefer a password in
  addition: set it under Settings → Panel password.
- The relay must be reachable from the *browser's* point of view, not the server's. The Overview page
  probes the relay at the address the panel itself was opened from (falling back to the configured
  `relay.host`), because probing `127.0.0.1` from a remote browser tests the remote device's loopback
  and reports a healthy relay as unreachable.

The full threat model is in [Security](21-security.md). Cookie-based authentication against model
providers is **never** supported, for any provider, and the panel does not offer it.

## Resource discipline

The panel polls for health and status. It **stops polling while the tab is hidden**, and resumes on
focus.

This is a small thing that says something about the project. A background tab left open for a week
making a request every few seconds is thousands of pointless requests — to a loopback socket, on the
same machine that is serving inference. It is exactly the kind of waste the router exists to remove,
and it would be strange for the router's own panel to be the thing doing it.

The same reasoning drives the rest of the panel: it holds no more history than it displays, it does
no work while no one is looking, and it starts no timers it cannot stop.

## Implementation constraints

The panel is **plain HTML, CSS and ES modules**, served as static files by the conductor. There is no
framework, no build step, and no CDN.

Each of those is a choice with a cost:

- **No framework** means the views are small hand-written modules. It also means there is no
  dependency tree to audit, and no supply-chain risk in a component that handles provider
  credentials.
- **No build step** means editing the panel is edit-and-reload. It also means the panel cannot use
  JSX, TypeScript, or single-file components — a real limitation, accepted because the panel is
  small enough not to need them.
- **No CDN** means the panel works with no internet access, which is the normal state of a machine
  running a local router. A panel that fails to load its own stylesheet because the network is down
  would be an obvious own goal.

The panel is served from the `panel/` directory on disk, located once at startup by searching the
working directory, its parents, and the executable's directory, so there is no build step, no
`node_modules`, and no version skew against the API it talks to. A missing `panel/` directory degrades to a placeholder page rather than a crash.
