# Quota tracking

Quota is the reason most multi-provider setups break. A request fails not because a model is down but
because one credential has hit a limit, and the router must know that before it picks it again.

## Four things that get conflated

Other routers tend to use "quota" for all four of these. They behave differently, they are observed
differently, and conflating them produces a router that either gives up too early or retries into a
wall.

| Kind | Example | Observable by Manarouter? |
|---|---|---|
| **Rate limit** | 500 requests/minute, 200k tokens/minute | **Yes**, from response headers and `retry-after`. |
| **Subscription usage window** | A plan's rolling 5-hour or weekly allowance | **Partly.** Only when the provider exposes it; otherwise it is declared by the operator. |
| **Spend budget** | $20/month on an API key | **No.** A budget is a billing concept; the provider does not tell the router about it. |
| **Credit balance** | Prepaid account with $3.14 left | **Only** through an optional provider-specific probe. |

The honest position is that Manarouter tracks what it can observe and does not pretend to track what
it cannot. A budget is something you set in a provider's billing console; the router learns about it
the moment the provider starts returning 402 or 429, and not before.

## Live signals first, declared windows second

A request against a provider is itself a measurement. Every response carries evidence about how much
quota is left, and discarding it in favour of a locally declared limit is throwing away knowledge in
exchange for a guess.

So the rule is:

> **Read the upstream's own signals. Fall back to the operator's declared window only where the
> provider has said nothing.**

If the two disagree, the **live signal wins**, because it is a measurement and the declared window is
a configuration. This is ratified decision Q4, and the `live_signals_win` flag in `QuotaConfig` exists
so the operator can turn it off deliberately — for a provider whose headers are known to be wrong —
rather than because the router guessed.

### What is read

| Signal | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `retry-after` | Any 429 or 503 | Both forms: a number of seconds, and an **HTTP date**. The date form is the one implementations get wrong, and a naive parse of it yields a multi-decade cooldown. |
| `x-ratelimit-limit-requests`, `-remaining-requests`, `-reset-requests` | OpenAI-compatible | `-reset-requests` is a duration, not an instant. |
| `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens`, `-remaining-tokens`, `-reset-tokens` | OpenAI-compatible | Absent on many providers. Its absence is normal, not an error. |
| `anthropic-ratelimit-requests-*`, `-tokens-*`, `-input-tokens-*`, `-output-tokens-*` | Anthropic | Separate input and output token budgets, which most providers do not have. |
| `reset_at` / `reset` inside a 429 body | Various | **Not standardised.** The field name and its unit differ per provider, so each is parsed per provider family rather than guessed at generically. |
| `x-balance-*`, `x-credit-*` | Various reseller and gateway hosts | A balance in a header, read by the [candidate-endpoint walk](#candidate-quota-endpoints) and only when no body answered. Covers `x-balance`, `x-balance-limit`, `x-balance-total`, `x-balance-remaining`, `x-balance-available`, `x-credit-limit`, `x-credit-total`, `x-credit-remaining` and `x-credit-balance`; a limit with no consumption is a total, never a spent fraction. |

### When nothing is said

The configured `default_cooldown_secs` (default **60**) applies, and the account is marked
`rate-limited`.

**That is a guess, not knowledge**, and the panel shows it differently from a cooldown whose reset
instant was reported by the provider. An operator looking at a 60-second cooldown that keeps renewing
can see that the provider is not telling the router anything and that the configured default is what
is driving it.

## Configuration

```json
{
  "quota": {
    "enabled": true,
    "live_signals_win": true,
    "default_cooldown_secs": 60,
    "auth_failure_cooldown_secs": 900,
    "failures_before_dead": 3
  },
  "quotaProbe": {
    "enabled": true,
    "paths": [
      "/v1/balance",
      "/api/balance",
      "/api/v1/key",
      "/v1/key",
      "/v1/user/info",
      "/v1/dashboard/billing/subscription",
      "/v1/credits",
      "/v1/quota",
      "/v1/usage"
    ],
    "chat_completion_probe": true
  }
}
```

`quota` says whether and how often a limit is tracked; `quotaProbe` says **where to look** for one on a
provider nobody wrote a reader for. It is a sibling of `quota`, not a part of it, and it is described
[below](#candidate-quota-endpoints). The panel edits the same section under Settings → **Quota
probing**, where the list can be reordered and reset to the built-in one; the file remains the only
place an individual account's own override is written.

Per-account windows are declared on the account:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "label": "work",
  "windows": [
    { "name": "rpm", "kind": "rolling", "seconds": 60, "limit_requests": 500 },
    { "name": "daily", "kind": "fixed", "seconds": 86400, "limit_requests": 10000 },
    { "name": "weekly", "kind": "provider-declared", "seconds": 0, "limit_tokens": 0 }
  ]
}
```

### The three window kinds

| Kind | Starts | Resets | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rolling` | At the first request in the window | `seconds` after it started | The provider describes a sliding window, e.g. "500 requests per minute". |
| `fixed` | On a wall-clock boundary | On the next boundary | The provider's limit is aligned to the clock — hourly, or daily at midnight UTC. |
| `provider-declared` | Learned from the upstream's headers | When the upstream says | The provider tells you, and you do not want to guess its schedule. With `seconds: 0` and no limits, this window exists purely to record what the provider reports. |

The distinction between `rolling` and `fixed` is not academic. With a 60-second rolling window, a
burst at the start of one minute and another burst 61 seconds later is legal. With a fixed
per-minute window, the same two bursts may land in the same minute and be rejected. A router that
assumes the wrong one will either under-use its quota or overrun it.

### Candidate quota endpoints

A provider nobody has written a reader for usually still publishes its allowance somewhere, and the
places it is published are a short, well-worn list. `quotaProbe` is that list, and the generic
OpenAI-compatible reader walks it in order, stopping at the first candidate that actually says
something about a quota.

| # | Candidate | Method |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/v1/balance` | `GET` |
| 2 | `/api/balance` | `GET` |
| 3 | `/api/v1/key` | `GET` |
| 4 | `/v1/key` | `GET` |
| 5 | `/v1/user/info` | `GET` |
| 6 | `/v1/dashboard/billing/subscription` | `GET` |
| 7 | `/v1/credits` | `GET` |
| 8 | `/v1/quota` | `GET` |
| 9 | `/v1/usage` | `GET` |
| 10 | `/v1/chat/completions` | `POST`, one token, read for its headers only |

The rules the walk keeps, and the reason each one exists:

- **A candidate is a path, never a URL.** `http://`, `https://` and a leading `//` are refused, and
  the error names the offending entry. Every request carries the account's credential, so a list that
  could name a host would be a way to hand a working key to a third party by editing one line of a
  configuration file. The check runs when the file is loaded and again as each request is built, and
  the request is sent only if the resolved URL is still on the account's own base-URL host.
- **`404` and `405` mean "not served here", and the walk goes on.** Those are the normal answers from
  an upstream that publishes no such path; treating them as a failure would stop at the first
  candidate on nearly every provider.
- **Any other non-2xx stops the walk.** A `401` or `403` says the credential is wrong, a `429` says
  the account is out until the reset, and a `5xx` says the upstream is unwell. Nine further requests
  after one of those spend a real credential on an answer already known.
- **A `2xx` only counts if a quota resolves from it.** The body goes through the same extractor the
  declared-`quotaEndpoint` path uses, refusal included: a body that merely mentions a number is not a
  quota, and a `remaining` on its own has no denominator to report a fraction against.
- **Headers are the last resort, not a first reading.** `x-ratelimit-*` first, then `x-balance-*` and
  `x-credit*`, are read only from a `2xx` whose body resolved nothing. A header fallback that
  outranked a body would misreport an account whose body says exactly what is left.
- **A limit with no consumption is not a consumed fraction.** A limit alone (say
  `x-ratelimit-limit-requests: 500`) is recorded as a total with `fraction_reported: false`, exactly
  as a `total` with no `used` is: turning it into `used = total` would paint a healthy account as
  exhausted. A family with no positive limit, or with only a remaining figure, contributes nothing —
  no row is ever `0/0`.
- **The one-token `POST` needs a model and is tried last.** `POST /v1/chat/completions` is the one
  endpoint an OpenAI-compatible upstream is certain to serve, so it is the last place a rate-limit
  header can come from — but it is a real completion request, spending real quota, so it runs after
  every path and only when a model is named:

  ```json
  { "quotaProbe": { "paths": ["/v1/balance"], "model": "your-model-id" } }
  ```

  No model id is invented when none is configured: a hard-coded one would aim probes at a model the
  account may not have and spend its quota proving that. `chat_completion_probe: false` disables the
  `POST` outright.
- **A walk is bounded at 25 requests**, however long the list is. The list is operator-editable and
  every entry spends the credential, so an unconsidered two-hundred entry list would be a denial of
  service against the account itself. A too-long list is trimmed rather than rejected: the first
  entries are the ones the operator meant.
- **The walk runs only when quota tracking runs**, and never in the background. `quotaProbe.enabled`
  switches the walk itself off, and a walk only ever happens inside a quota read that `quota.enabled`
  has already allowed — there is no timer and no polling anywhere in this path, so nothing here
  contacts an upstream on its own.

An account overrides the list, because one account on a reseller host may need a different path from
the next:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "label": "work",
  "quotaProbe": ["/api/v1/key", "/v1/balance"]
}
```

An array is a path list and inherits everything else from the configured section. An object may set
any field, so an account that only wants a different model does not have to repeat the whole list:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "label": "work",
  "quotaProbe": {
    "enabled": true,
    "paths": ["/api/v1/key"],
    "chat_completion_probe": false,
    "model": "the-model-this-account-uses"
  }
}
```

Anything else — a string, a number, or an object with a non-string path — is refused with a message
saying what was expected, rather than walked with a guess.

## Why quota is per account, not per provider

Two API keys on one provider have independent limits. Two OAuth accounts on one subscription may have
separate allowances, or may share one, depending on the provider. But the *consumption* is always
per credential: a rate limit is applied to the key that made the request.

So the tracked unit is the account. A provider's health is a **rollup** and is never a statement
about quota:

```text
ProviderHealth::from_counts(total, usable)
  total  == 0  ->  Unconfigured   (nothing is configured, which is not a failure)
  usable == 0  ->  Dead
  usable == total ->  Healthy
  otherwise    ->  Degraded
```

`Unconfigured` and `Dead` are deliberately different states. A provider the operator has not set up
yet, or whose accounts they have all disabled on purpose, is not broken — and the panel must not paint
it red, or operators learn to ignore red.

## What a refusal is recorded against: `cooldown_scope`

The *usage* is per credential, but the *limit* that refused a request is not always the credential's.
OpenAdapter's free plan counts Pro models apart from Lite ones and Antigravity publishes a quota per
model, so a 429 that means "this account has spent its Pro allowance" says nothing about that account's
Lite capacity. Recording it against the bare account throws the sibling models away with it.

Each provider therefore carries a `cooldown_scope`, and the key a refusal lands under follows it:

| `cooldown_scope` | Recorded against | Consulted for a request |
|---|---|---|
| `account` (default) | the account | the account |
| `model` | the account **and the model** | the account, then that model on the account |
| `provider` | **the provider and the model** | the account, then the model on every account of the provider |

A lookup consults the account-shaped key plus the one wider shape the scope adds, never a narrower
one, so a refusal recorded for one model cannot spread to its siblings. Two consequences of that rule
are worth stating outright:

- the reset instant for a route is the **latest** of the keys parking it — a route is free only when
  every fact that refused it has expired;
- `step_earliest_reset` and the last-resort pick take the **earliest** across accounts — the demoted
  step comes back as soon as *anything* can serve it.

Two facts are fixed rather than configurable, because they describe the credential instead of a limit:
`AuthFailed` is always recorded against the bare account (the credential is broken for every model),
and a malformed request records nothing at all.

The default is `account`, so an existing configuration behaves exactly as before. Changing the scope
does not migrate live entries — they keep the shape they were recorded under and expire on their own
within one cooldown window. `model` also multiplies the live entries by the number of refused models;
see [the entry count caveat](#the-entry-count-caveat).

## The cooldown lifecycle

```text
  request  ->  429 with retry-after: 47
                  |
                  v
       key = cooldown_key(cooldown_scope, ...)   (the account, account+model, or provider+model)
       key.state = RateLimited
       key.reset_at = now + 47s    (from the header: knowledge)
                  |
                  v
       every KeyStrategy skips the routes that key parks
       (priority moves on, round-robin skips it, least-used ignores it)
                  |
                  v
       the entry is left in place; each selection
       compares now against reset_at (`is_over(now)`)
                  |
                  v
       once now >= reset_at the key parks nothing
       a reset-aware combo promotes the step back to its authored position
```

Under the default `cooldown_scope` the key *is* the account, which is what the rest of this document
calls a cooldown. Read "the account" below as "the key that was refused" wherever a scoped key
applies.

There is no timer thread in either process: a cooldown is in-memory state in the relay, and "expired"
is computed lazily the next time a selection looks at the account. Nothing polls, and nothing wakes
up at `reset_at`.

Under `reset-aware-priority`, a step whose accounts are **all** cooling down is **demoted below every
healthy step, never removed** — so the operator's preferred model is the first thing tried again the
moment its quota returns. That is documented in
[Reset-aware priority](09-reset-aware-priority.md).

What a client sees during a cooldown: nothing different, provided another step is usable. The request
succeeds against a lower-priority step. If every step for every account is cooling down, the relay
returns a 429 **of its own** — distinguishable from a forwarded one, which
[the API reference](18-api-reference.md) describes.

## The entry count caveat

A cooldown entry disappears when its key next **succeeds**, or when a selection notices it has expired;
there is no pruning timer. That was invisible under the account-only default — one entry per refused
credential, a few dozen at most. A scoped key makes the count a function of the catalogue instead: one
entry per refused model under `model`, and under `provider` a single entry shared by every account
that serves it.

The entries are small — a key, an instant, a reason, a failure count — and a refused model is not
retried until its window passes, so the practical ceiling is "models actually refused in the last
window", not "models configured". That is still enough for a provider with hundreds of models and a
per-model quota to be worth a glance: `/control/activity` lists every parked shape, and a `model` key
shows up in composed form rather than as a bare account id.

## Why a 401 and a 429 are treated oppositely

| | 401 / 403 | 429 |
|---|---|---|
| Meaning | The credential is wrong | The credential is fine, it is being throttled |
| Will a retry help? | **No** | **Yes**, after the reset |
| Cooldown | `auth_failure_cooldown_secs` (**900**) | `retry-after`, or `default_cooldown_secs` (**60**) |
| State | `auth-failed` | `rate-limited` |
| Panel wording | "Log in again" / "Check the key" | "Cooling down until 14:32" |

A 900-second cooldown on a 401 is not a penalty; it is an acknowledgement that the operator has to do
something before a retry can possibly work. Retrying a bad key every 60 seconds produces logs that
hide the one line that matters, and a decade of experience says the operator will not notice.

## Failures before dead

> **Status.** Declared by the configuration and parsed, but **not yet consulted at selection time**. The
> relay counts consecutive failures and uses the count to grow a guessed cooldown; nothing marks an
> account `Dead`. Treat the paragraph below as the intended semantics, not as current behaviour.

`failures_before_dead` (default 3) is the number of consecutive failures — of any kind, after cooldown
handling — before an account is marked `Dead` rather than `Degraded`.

The reason this is a count and not a boolean: a single failure is almost always the network, the
provider, or a transient 5xx. Marking an account dead on one failure means a brief provider wobble
takes a perfectly good credential out of rotation. Three consecutive failures is a pattern.

The counter **resets on any success**. That is what makes it a measure of consecutive failure rather
than of lifetime unreliability, and it is why an account that fails twice a day but succeeds a
thousand times is never marked dead.

## Hedging costs quota

> **Status.** The race runs, so a hedge does spend quota today. The accounting below is the
> behaviour, not a proposal. One caveat the race adds: a loser is dropped when the winner is
> committed, and the tokens a loser had already produced are not accounted to the key — the key is
> charged for the winner's usage.

This is stated plainly because it is a real cost that is easy to forget when reading about the
latency benefit.

If a hedge sends a request to three participants and one wins, **the other two also consumed quota**.
For a non-streaming request, a loser may have been cancelled before its first byte — which is why
`cancel_losers` is on by default and why cancelling early matters — but a loser that had already
begun generating has spent tokens that were billed.

Two consequences:

- **Hedging trades quota for latency.** On a subscription with a tight five-hour window, a hedge that
  triples request volume will exhaust it three times faster. [Hedged race §4](07-hedged-race.md)
  discusses when that trade is worth making.
- **The spend is attributed to each account, not to the combo.** Usage records show the losing legs
  against their own accounts. A combo-level view would be tidier but would misattribute the cost, and
  the cost is attached to the credential that was charged.

## Credit balances

Some providers expose a balance endpoint, and neither they nor the router standardise its shape. Three
ways to reach one are intended, in order of how much is known about the provider:

1. a dedicated reader, for the hosts whose balance shape was read out of their own documentation — see
   [which providers report a live allowance](user/06-quota.md#which-providers-report-a-live-allowance);
2. an account-level `quotaEndpoint`, for a host whose operator knows the path;
3. the [candidate-endpoint walk](#candidate-quota-endpoints), for everything else: the list of paths
   is tried in order, and a body that resolves a total and a remaining figure — or a `x-balance-*` /
   `x-credit-*` header on a body that resolved nothing — becomes the account's reported row on the
   quota page. It arrives there as a **window**, carrying the source `openai-compatible` and the
   display name `rate limit (credits)`, not as a separate "balance" field: the panel has one shape for
   "how full is this allowance", and inventing a second one for money would mean the balance is the
   only number that never appears in the view an operator actually looks at.

What is **not** implemented is the probing *schedule*: the walk is a reader, so it runs inside a quota
read — the panel's refresh — and not off the request path on a long interval. It also cannot run at all
until the conductor asks for a quota read on an account that declares nothing, which it does not do
yet (see the status note under [candidate quota endpoints](#candidate-quota-endpoints)).

A balance that cannot be fetched is shown as **unknown**, never as zero. Displaying an unreadable
balance as zero would suggest an account is empty when it may be perfectly full, and would send an
operator hunting for a problem that does not exist. The same rule holds for a balance that is only
partly readable: a limit with no consumption is reported as a total with `fraction_reported: false`,
so the panel shows the ceiling without claiming to know how much of it is gone.

## What is recorded per request

> **Status.** Nothing is recorded yet. `Store` has the `usage` table and `record_usage` API, and
> `/api/quota` can read it, but **no code in the relay or the conductor ever calls the writer** — the
> relay does not mention usage at all. In a real deployment the table stays empty, so `/api/quota`
> reports nothing regardless of traffic and no quota window is enforced from recorded usage. What does
> work today is the live-signal path: a `429`/`401` observed on the request path sets an in-memory
> cooldown (see `QuotaConfig`). The table below is the intended record.

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Account and provider | Which credential was charged |
| Model | The model id as sent upstream, not the combo name |
| Prompt and completion tokens | **Optional.** A streamed response may report no usage at all. |
| Duration | Wall clock, end to end |
| Outcome | Success, upstream error, or router error |
| Hedge role | **Which participant won and which lost** |

Token counts are partial by nature. Many providers report no usage on a streamed response, and some
report it only on the final chunk. A usage figure that looks lower than reality usually means "the
provider did not tell us", not "the tokens were free", and the panel is meant to say which responses
lacked usage rather than silently summing what it has.

## Where the data lives

The home for usage and quota history is **`state.sqlite`**, never `config.json`: the
configuration is meant to be readable, diffable and version-controllable, and a file that changes on
every request is none of those. The relay records a `key_usage` row per request, and the schema also
carries `usage`, `account_health` and `provider_quota_state`; the conductor serves them through
`/api/usage` and `/api/quota`.

What is *not* there today is live cooldown state. The relay's cooldowns (from `429`/`401` signals and
`QuotaConfig`) are held in memory in the relay process and are never written to the database, so they
are lost when the relay restarts, and deleting `state.sqlite` does not clear them. **Back the file
up before deleting it:** it also holds the per-key usage ledger and the OAuth credential rows, and
neither can be reconstructed.

Retention is the operator's decision. There is no default pruning, because silently deleting an
operator's usage history is worse than an unpruned database, and the panel shows the file's size so
the decision can be made with information.

## How the panel paints a window

The Quota view answers one question — *how much is left, and when does it come back* — so it shows
the number in words, the bar and the reset countdown together, and every one of those is derived
from the same snapshot.

- **Only a window the provider quantified is drawn.** The panel renders the windows that are in the
  snapshot, in `5h`, `1w`, `30d` order, one row each. A provider that reports a single weekly window
  gets a single row; the page never pads itself with placeholder rows for families that provider did
  not mention. This is presentation only — `/api/quota` still carries every window it was told
  about.
- **A snapshot with nothing quantified is not a card.** An account that has never been fetched, or
  whose only window came back without a fraction, is left off the page instead of appearing as an
  empty shell with three `N/A` rows. An account whose fetch *failed* keeps its card and shows the
  error, because "the provider would not answer" is a fact worth seeing.
- **Bars fill with what is REMAINING**, not what is spent. An empty bar means "nothing left", which
  is the thing an operator acts on; a full bar means "fresh window".
- **Colour is a second copy of the number, never the only copy.** Green above 50 % left, amber at
  50 % or less, red at 20 % or less. The thresholds live in one exported constant pair in
  `panel/format.js` and every chip, bar and card border asks it, so the same window cannot be green
  in one place and amber in another.
- **No measurement is grey, not red.** A provider that reports no fraction is `unknown`; painting it
  red would claim exhaustion the data does not support, and painting it green would claim headroom.
  An unlimited window is shown as `Unlimited` and is grey for the same reason: there is no number to
  colour.
- **The worst window decides the account.** A card takes the colour of its most exhausted window,
  because an account with one dead 5 h window is an account to look at whatever its weekly window says.
- **The countdown belongs to the row, not to a footnote.** `Resets in: 2 h 15 m` trails the
  percentage on the right of each window. A reset instant in the past reads `Resets now`; a window
  with no reset instant reads `Reset time unknown` rather than inventing a time.
- **The at-a-glance strip is a signpost, not a summary.** One line per account lists each window as a
  chip (name, percentage left, colour, same `Resets in:` countdown); clicking a chip scrolls to that
  account's card. It exists so the operator can find the tired account without reading every card.
- **Source and details stay in the API.** The cached snapshot also holds `source` and per-window
  `details` (for example `retrieveUserQuota` and a per-model remaining count) and `/api/quota`
  returns them for debugging. The page does not print them: a wall of raw provider keys beside the
  percentage buries the one number the page exists to show.

Nothing here invents data: a window with no reset time says so, and the page gives each card the age
of its snapshot, because a quota figure without an age is a claim about now that nobody made.

## Limitations

Stated so they are not discovered later. Most of these describe the intended accounting; only what
the provider actually reports reaches the ledger:

- **The candidate-endpoint walk is not reached in a running deployment yet.** It is implemented and
  tested in `mr-core`, but the conductor still fetches quota only for accounts that declare a
  `quotaEndpoint` — and those are exactly the accounts that never need the walk. See the status note
  under [candidate quota endpoints](#candidate-quota-endpoints).
- **Usage a provider does not report is not counted.** Streamed responses frequently omit it.
- **Requests that fail before reaching the provider are not counted against quota**, correctly — they
  did not consume any — but they do appear in the error rate.
- **Race spend is attributed per account**, not per combo, so a combo's total cost is not a single
  figure.
- **A dropped usage record is counted, not retried** (by design). The intended usage channel is bounded
  so a slow disk cannot stall a request, and when it is full the drop is recorded and surfaced. Losing
  a usage row is preferable to adding latency to a completion, and pretending the row exists is worse
  than both.
- **Spend budgets and credit balances are not enforced.** The router can tell you a provider is
  returning 402; it cannot predict it.
- **A candidate endpoint list is a guess about paths, not knowledge about a provider.** The nine
  `GET` candidates and the one-token `POST` cover what resellers and gateways commonly serve; a host
  that publishes its allowance somewhere else is not read until the operator adds the path, and one
  that answers `200` with something that is not a quota is passed over rather than trusted.
- **The walk spends the account's credential, once per candidate.** Nine `404`s is nine authenticated
  requests against that account's rate limit — the reason the list is short, the reason a walk is
  bounded, and the reason the only candidate that actually generates text is the one-token `POST` at
  the end.
- **A walked reading is as fresh as the last quota read.** The walk cannot refresh itself: there is no
  background polling anywhere in this subsystem, so the number on the page is the number from the last
  refresh the operator (or the panel) asked for.
