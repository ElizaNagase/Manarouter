//! The compiled routing snapshot: the flat, pre-resolved routing table the relay reads on every
//! request.
//!
//! ## Why there are two representations
//!
//! The authored configuration in [`crate::config`] is rich and hand-editable: it may hold disabled
//! providers, disabled accounts, hidden models, aliases that chain, hedges whose participant list
//! is implicit, and steps that point at providers which no longer exist. None of that should be
//! interpreted while a request is in flight. The compiler in this module flattens the authored
//! form once, at the moment the operator saves, into the layout below.
//!
//! The relay's contract is deliberately narrow: it loads a snapshot, swaps it in through a
//! [`SnapshotHandle`], and from then on asks one question per request — "what does `model` mean?"
//! — which is one hash lookup and one string comparison.
//!
//! ## What "no per-request parse" does and does not buy
//!
//! It **does** buy that every interpretation decision is made here and never again. Account order
//! is resolved (disabled accounts dropped, the rest sorted by priority), hidden models are gone,
//! hedge participant indices are remapped onto the surviving steps, alias chains are followed to a
//! final target, and the lookup index that answers `provider/model`, bare model ids and combo names
//! is built once. The request path is an atomic load of an `Arc` plus a hash lookup; it never
//! walks a `Config`, sorts anything, or resolves an alias chain.
//!
//! It does **not** buy literal zero-copy reads out of a memory-mapped file. [`RoutingSnapshot::decode`]
//! validates the frame and then builds owned `String`s and `Vec`s, so a decoded snapshot lives on
//! the ordinary heap. The on-disk form is still a versioned, checksummed, string-deduplicated
//! binary frame, because the same bytes have to cross a process boundary and must fail closed when
//! truncated or corrupted; but a reader should not expect the in-memory snapshot to borrow from
//! the file it came from. Truly zero-copy would require a layout-stable `repr(C)` schema and an
//! mmap whose lifetime is tied to the file, and the portability and validation costs of that are
//! not worth paying for a table that is read once per reload. This is an honest trade, not an
//! accident: the earlier ambition of reading fields straight out of shared memory was given up in
//! favour of a format that can be validated and rejected cleanly.
//!
//! ## The on-disk frame
//!
//! ```text
//! magic[8] | version u32 | digest u64 | payload_len u32 | checksum u64 | payload[..]
//! ```
//!
//! `checksum` is FNV-1a over `version || digest || payload`, so a single flipped byte anywhere
//! meaningful is caught by [`verify_header`] before any structure is built. `payload_len` is
//! separately checked against the actual byte count, which is what turns a truncated file into a
//! precise "truncated" error rather than a successful parse of a half-valid routing table.
//!
//! The payload begins with a string table and refers to every string by index. Provider ids, base
//! URLs, header names, model ids and auth-kind parameter names repeat heavily across the table, and
//! the string table is what keeps the frame from being dominated by the same slug copied a hundred
//! times. A step therefore stores only its provider index and model; every other per-step field is
//! reconstructed from the provider it points at, so there is exactly one copy of each base URL and
//! timeout in the compiled form.
//!
//! ## Precedence and the lookup index
//!
//! One requested string can match several things at once: an alias `from`, a combo id, a combo
//! name, a `provider/model` pair, and a bare model id might all be the same text. The index is a
//! `HashMap<u64, u32>` keyed on `fnv1a64` of the ASCII-lowercased key, where the value is the head
//! of a chain of [`IndexEntry`] records. Every entry carries its original (folded) key and a
//! precedence rank, and a lookup walks the chain comparing the **full string** — a hash collision
//! therefore costs one extra comparison, it never routes to the wrong combo. When several entries
//! genuinely share a key, the lowest rank wins: alias, then combo id, then combo name, then
//! `provider/model`, then bare model id.
