//! The two rental entities: a platform **account**, and a deployment — one model on one GPU.
//!
//! ## Why two entities and not one
//!
//! The operator's requirement 8 is explicit: *"Multiple models may be hosted under the same
//! account; account creation should be separate from model setup."* So a [`RentalAccount`] is a
//! workspace credential with no model attached, and many deployments may share it. Creating the
//! credential and choosing the model are two different acts, made at two different times, and
//! the types keep them apart.
//!
//! ## Why an account is not a [`crate::model::Provider`]
//!
//! A provider requires a `base_url`. A Modal account has none: each app gets its own
//! `https://<workspace>--<app>-<fn>.modal.run` URL, and there is no workspace-level base URL to
//! put in the field. An account modelled as a provider would therefore have to carry a lie in a
//! mandatory field. [`crate::config::Config::rental_accounts`] is the honest home instead, and it
//! is the seam the later GPU-rental issues plug into.
//!
//! ## Why a deployment *is* a provider
//!
//! The inverse reasoning applies. A deployment — one model, reachable at a URL, with a KV-token
//! budget, a per-second price and a cold-start tolerance — is exactly what
//! [`crate::model::Provider`] already is, and the relay already enforces those budget fields on
//! the request path. Re-modelling it would duplicate all of that. So a deployment is **stored in
//! `Provider.extra["rental"]`** and parsed into [`RentalDeployment`] on demand.
//!
//! That choice is not merely convenient, it is required: `RoutingSnapshot` builds its own
//! `ProviderPlan` struct, so `Provider.extra` is not part of the compiled snapshot layout and
//! adding keys to it cannot shift a byte in the file the relay reads. A new `Provider` field
//! would force a [`crate::SNAPSHOT_VERSION`] bump for no runtime benefit, because the relay never
//! reads a GPU name. See `docs/research/ARCHITECTURE-gpu-rentals.md` §3.2. **[facts]**
//!
//! ## Storage is flexible; the code that reads it is not
//!
//! `Provider.extra` is an untyped map, so it will happily hold `"gpu": 42` or a `rental` object
//! with the GPU name misspelled. [`RentalDeployment::from_provider_extra`] therefore returns a
//! [`Result`] and a malformed value is a validation *error* the panel can report against the
//! offending field — never a silent default that quietly rents the wrong card.
//!
//! ## Scheduling concurrent GPU launches
//!
//! A deployment may request more than one GPU, and operators need to bring up deployments
//! sequentially (one card alive at a time) or in batches.  [`RentalSchedule`] expresses the
//! launch policy — sequential or batched with a ceiling — and [`plan_launch`] turns a list of
//! deployments into waves respecting that ceiling.
