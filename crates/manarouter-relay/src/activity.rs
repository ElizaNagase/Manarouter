//! The relay's memory of the combo decisions it has made.
//!
//! # Why this lives in the relay and not in the database
//!
//! A combo decision is made by the relay, from a compiled snapshot it already holds, and the panel
//! asks about it while it is happening. Writing each one to the control plane's database would put
//! a row write on the request path to answer a question about "right now", and it would make the
//! panel's live view depend on durability it does not need. This is a fixed ring of the last few
//! decisions, held for the life of the process: restarting the relay forgets them, which is the
//! honest scope of a fact about in-flight work.
//!
//! # Why the entry ends when the body does
//!
//! "In flight" means the client is still receiving the answer, and the only thing in this process
//! that knows when that stops being true is the response body itself. A timer would have to guess
//! how long a stream runs, and a guess is exactly the wrong thing to show an operator debugging a
//! slow route. So the entry is finished by a [`ActivityGuard`] that the client-facing body owns: the
//! guard is dropped when the body is dropped, which is when the relay has finished writing (or the
//! client stopped reading).
//!
//! # What is deliberately absent
//!
//! No labels, no account ids, no request ids, no bodies. The entry names the combo, the string the
//! client sent, and the `provider/model` the relay committed to — the three facts the question "what
//! is this combo doing" is made of. Nothing here can identify a person or carry a credential.
